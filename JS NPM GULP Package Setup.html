Installing Packages
This process allows files to be compiled at the right time.

1. NPM. Node Package Manager -  npm init
			- will create Package.json which is our manifest that stores our packages

NPM Packages
2. Gulp - npm install gulp --save-dev  or for global npm install gulp -g
			- optimizes our code and packages it up in a format that the browser can 					   			 
			  understand. It is also in charge or using all the other npm packages
			- will create node_modules which will be ignored
			- saves package list to package.json - similar to ruby cache.
			- gulp is used in development 
			- will need to make a gulpfile.js  which will need require and gulp.task code
			- gulp tasks need to be run in terminal each time your files change as you develop - gulp jsBrowserify

3. Browserify - npm install browserify --save-dev
			  - is responsible for using require and exports keywords to translate the code into JavaScript our browser does understand. 
			  - follows the require statements in the interface and collects all the code
			  - Gulp is used to run browserify	

4. Gitignore 	- .gitignore   node_modules
			- Commit the package.json file with the project but not the node_modules

5. When we clone the project to continue working on it, we simply run npm install and all packages saved to the manifest file will be downloaded into a new node_models/ folder

4. Vinyl-source-stream - npm install vinyl-source-stream --save-dev
					    - used for putting the browserified source code into a new file

5. Gulp - Concat - npm install gulp-concat --save-dev
				 - process of consolidating multiple interface files files into one 
				 - run gulp jsBrowserify for new version of browserify

6. Minifying with Gulp-uglify - npm install gulp-uglify --save-dev
			 			    - After require is added to gulpfile/tasks then you need to run gulp minifyScripts

7. Environmental Pro/Dev  with Gulp-util -  npm install gulp-util --save-dev
			 			    - Run   gulp build --production 				for production
						    - Run   gulp build 					 for developmental

8. Clean Tasks with del - npm install del --save-dev					 
					   - used to delete tmp and build folder

9. JSHint - linter - npm install jshint --save-dev
				- npm install gulp-jshint --save-dev					 
				 -  run gulp jshint to find errors

// Front-end
10. Install Bower - npm install bower -g		- bower install for setup from beginning
		  - sudo npm install bower -g
		  - bower init
		  - bower install jquery --save
		  - bower install bootstrap --save

11. Moment - bower install moment --save
		- lets us work with dates and times

12. Bower-files - npm install bower-files --save-dev
		- gulp bowerJS   run everytime we add a new js front end dependency
// Server
13. BrowserSync - npm install browser-sync --save-dev
		- for live reloading
		- gulp serve : launches local server
